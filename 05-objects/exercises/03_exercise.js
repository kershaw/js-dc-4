/*

You can pull in data from another file using JavaScripts `require()` method,
which you pass a path as a string to the file you wish to incldue. For instance,
you could require a json file like this:

var myJSON = require('./path/to/file.json')

Given the above, import `data.json` and save it to a variable.

Once json data is imported, it can be treated like a regular JavaScript object.
How cool is that?

Write a loop that will print out our JSON data as a string, in the following format:

Quick-E-Mart's Current Stock
Item, Color, Price
Aubergine, Purple, 1.59
Apple, Red, 0.78
Nuts, Brown, 2.23

*/
var myJSON = require('./data.json')
console.log(myJSON["Store Name"]+" " + "Current Stock")

var itemHeadings = Object.keys (myJSON.Foods[0] )
console.log (itemHeadings.join(', '))

for (i=0; i < myJSON.Foods.length; i++) {
  console.log(myJSON.Foods[i].name)
}
